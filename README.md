# [Girls Who Code](https://opencode18.github.io/Girls-who-code/)

Girls who code is a collaborative website made to acknowledge and encourge female developers. 
This website is made under [OpenCode](https://opencode18.github.io/), a month long event aimed to raise awareness about and help people get started with open source contribution. A minified version of GSOC, OpenCode is organised by the FOSS wing of IIIT-Allahabad's technical society, Geekhaven.
This project is exclusively build only for female contributors to give them a headstart in open source.
Together we can make things better. OS4W aims to be a resource for connecting all women, including women of color and transgender women, to open source projects that are welcoming, inclusive, and appreciative of diversity in their contributors.
# OUR GOALS
This project is started with an aim to get more woman contributors to Open Source. What we want is more females enchanted with the mysteries of open source and to feel happy and proud writing codes or contributing to an open source project.
